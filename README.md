# Data Center Operations Framework

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end operations system for managing data center environments using a structured, KPI-driven approach.

It is designed to reflect how high-performing operations teams ensure uptime, manage risk, optimize capacity, and maintain audit-ready systems.

---

## Why This Project

This project showcases how operational systems can be designed—not improvised—to manage complex environments.

It reflects a real-world approach where:

- Performance is measurable
- Processes are repeatable
- Systems are monitored continuously
- Improvements are driven by data

---

## Operating Philosophy

Operate the data center like a production system:

- Measurable
- Repeatable
- Monitored
- Preventive
- Continuously improved

---

## Core Framework (5 Pillars)

### 1. Infrastructure Reliability

Ensures uptime, redundancy, and system stability.

**KPIs:**
- Uptime %
- MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)
- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)

---

### 2. Capacity & Resource Planning

Optimizes rack space, power, and cooling usage.

**KPIs:**
- Rack utilization %
- Power utilization %
- Cooling utilization %
- Capacity forecast accuracy

---

### 3. Incident Management

Structured response to minimize downtime and prevent recurrence.

**Process:**
Detect → Alert → Respond → Resolve → RCA → Prevent

**KPIs:**
- Time to detect
- Time to resolve
- Repeat incident rate
- SLA compliance %

---

### 4. Compliance & Risk Control

Maintains audit readiness and operational integrity.

**Controls:**
- Access logs
- Change tracking
- Maintenance logs
- Incident documentation

---

### 5. Workflow Optimization & Automation

Improves efficiency and reduces manual operations.

**KPIs:**
- Automated task %
- Ticket backlog
- Preventive maintenance completion %
- Cost per rack

---

## System Overview

The data center operates as a closed-loop system:

Monitoring → Detection → Response → Resolution → Analysis → Prevention

Every incident feeds back into:

- Preventive maintenance
- Process improvement
- KPI optimization

---

## Dashboard (Operational Visibility)

This project includes an Excel-based KPI dashboard (`dashboard/data_center_operations_dashboard.xlsx`) designed to simulate real-world monitoring and executive reporting across six sheets:

| Sheet | Contents |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | Executive KPI tiles, operational summary, capacity by zone, trend table |
| KPI_Tracker | Monthly KPI data — uptime, MTTR, MTBF, SLA compliance, PM completion |
| Incident_Log | Full incident history with TTA, TTR, root cause, and preventive action |
| Capacity | Zone-level rack, power, and cooling utilization with dynamic risk flags |
| PM_Checklist | Preventive maintenance tasks with live completion rate formula |
| Lists | Dropdown validation lists for data entry consistency |

Dashboard metric definitions and visual requirements are documented in `dashboard/dashboard_metric_definitions.md`.

## Key Deliverables

- Excel KPI dashboard with live formulas across 6 sheets
- Incident tracking system with severity, zone, and time metrics
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) framework
- Preventive maintenance checklist (daily / weekly / monthly)
- KPI tracking model (uptime, MTTR, MTBF, SLA, PM completion)
- Executive reporting structure
- Capacity tracking system with dynamic risk flagging
- Worked incident scenarios (cooling failure, power fluctuation, network latency)
- Interview positioning guide

---

## Example Use Case

A cooling failure in one zone triggers a monitoring alert.

- Alert is acknowledged
- Workload is redistributed
- Technician is dispatched
- Issue is resolved

Root cause analysis identifies airflow obstruction.

A preventive inspection process is implemented to eliminate recurrence.

See `docs/incident-scenarios.md` for three fully worked examples.
